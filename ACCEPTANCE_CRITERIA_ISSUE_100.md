## üìà VALIDATION PROCEDURES

### Pre-Implementation Validation
1. **Run TDD tests**: All tests MUST fail initially (RED phase)
   ```bash
   pytest test_parallel_agent_coordination.py -v
   # Expected: All tests fail - this confirms proper TDD setup
   ```

### Implementation Validation  
2. **Incremental testing**: Tests pass as features are implemented (GREEN phase)
   ```bash
   pytest test_parallel_agent_coordination.py::TestParallelAgentCoordination -v
   # Expected: Tests gradually turn GREEN as coordination is implemented
   ```

### Quality Validation
3. **Code quality checks**: All quality gates pass
   ```bash
   flake8 knowledge_storm/coordination/
   pylint knowledge_storm/coordination/  
   mypy knowledge_storm/coordination/
   black --check knowledge_storm/coordination/
   ```

### Performance Validation
4. **Benchmark testing**: Performance targets achieved
   ```bash
   python -m pytest test_parallel_agent_coordination.py::TestAgentCoordinationPerformance -v
   # Expected: <6s end-to-end, >70% utilization
   ```

### Integration Validation
5. **Full system test**: Complete research pipeline functional
   ```bash
   python -c "
   import asyncio
   from knowledge_storm.modules.multi_agent_knowledge_curation import MultiAgentKnowledgeCurationModule
   
   async def validate_integration():
       module = MultiAgentKnowledgeCurationModule()
       result = await module.research('climate change impacts')
       print(f'‚úÖ Duration: {result.duration:.2f}s (target: <6s)')
       print(f'‚úÖ Quality: {result.quality_score:.2f} (target: >0.8)')
       assert result.duration < 6.0
       assert result.quality_score > 0.8
       print('üéØ All acceptance criteria MET!')
   
   asyncio.run(validate_integration())
   "
   ```
