# PR74 Fixes Summary

## Summary of Issues Addressed

Based on the code review of PR74, the following issues have been fixed:

### MUST FIX (Completed)

1. **Unsafe Test Skipping** (test_research_planner.py:323)
   - Changed broad `except Exception as e:` to specific `except (ImportError, ModuleNotFoundError) as e:`
   - This prevents hiding legitimate bugs while still handling missing dependencies

### SUGGESTED Improvements

1. **Dependency Injection** (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
   - ResearchPlannerAgent already supports dependency injection for ResearchPlanner
   - Constructor accepts optional `planner` parameter with fallback to default instance

2. **Method Cohesion (SRP)** (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
   - Caching logic already extracted into `@cache_with_timeout` decorator
   - ResearchPlanner.plan_research is clean and focused on business logic

3. **Code Duplication** (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
   - MultiAgentKnowledgeCurationModule already uses `_execute_agent_task` helper method
   - Repetitive try/except blocks consolidated into single reusable method

4. **Test Coverage for Edge Cases** (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
   - Comprehensive edge case tests already added:
     - Empty topic validation
     - Whitespace-only topic validation
     - Cache failure handling
     - Security validation tests
     - Error handling in agent communication

### NIT (Completed)

1. **Unused Code Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive documentation to `optimize_multi_perspective_plan` method
   - Clarified it's maintained for future multi-perspective research features

2. **Logic Change Documentation**
   - Added comment in MultiAgentKnowledgeCurationModule.research() explaining the critical fix
   - Highlighted that research_result (not topic) is passed to Critic and Verifier agents

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- 13 tests passed
- 1 test skipped (DSPy dependency not available)
- Exception handling now properly narrowed to avoid masking bugs

## Code Quality Improvements

The codebase now follows:
- Sandi Metz principles (SRP, dependency injection)
- Google Style Guide standards
- Proper error handling and logging
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation of design decisions
