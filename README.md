An AI-assisted research and writing platform that enhances the original STORM (Synthesis of Topic Outline through Retrieval and Multi-perspective question asking) with academic rigor and verification capabilities.

## üéØ System Overview

**Primary System**: Enhanced STORM engine with academic research capabilities  
**Core Enhancement**: Citation verification and quality assurance for academic rigor  
**Architecture**: Multi-agent system with specialized academic research workflow

### Key Components

- **Enhanced STORM Engine** - Academic workflow selector and hybrid processing
- **Citation Verification** - Real-time academic source validation

- **Academic Workflow** - Comprehensive research pipeline with quality gates

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Clarification

This system combines:
1. **STORM Framework** - Original topic outline and article generation
2. **Academic Enhancements** - Research verification and quality assurance
3. **Verification Services** - Citation and claim validation

**Note**: This system does NOT include a "PRISMA Assistant" - that was a conceptual misunderstanding. The actual system focuses on enhancing STORM with academic verification capabilities.
