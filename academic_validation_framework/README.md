## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from academic_validation_framework import ComprehensiveTestRunner

async def validate_research():
    # Sample research output
    research_output = {
        "title": "Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Systematic Review",
        "content": "...",  # Your research content
        "citations": [...],  # Citation list
        "metadata": {"discipline": "Medicine", "methodology": "Systematic Review"}
    }
    
    # Create test runner
    runner = ComprehensiveTestRunner()
    
    try:
        # Run comprehensive validation
        session = await runner.run_comprehensive_validation(
            research_output=research_output,
            discipline="Medicine",
            citation_style="APA",
            methodology="Systematic Review"
        )
        
        # Check results
        print(f"Success Rate: {session.success_rate:.1%}")
        print(f"Tests Passed: {session.passed_count}/{session.total_count}")
        
        # Generate reports
        await runner.generate_comprehensive_reports(session)
        
    finally:
        await runner.cleanup()

# Run the validation
asyncio.run(validate_research())
```

### PRISMA-Specific Validation

```python
async def validate_systematic_review():
    runner = ComprehensiveTestRunner()
    
    try:
        # Run only PRISMA validation
        session = await runner.run_prisma_validation_only(
            research_output=research_output
        )
        
        # Check PRISMA compliance
        for result in session.results:
            if "prisma" in result.test_name.lower():
                print(f"{result.test_name}: {result.score:.2f}")
                
    finally:
        await runner.cleanup()
```

### Performance Benchmarking

```python
async def benchmark_performance():
    runner = ComprehensiveTestRunner()
    
    try:
        # Run performance benchmarks
        session = await runner.run_performance_benchmarks_only(
            research_output=research_output
        )
        
        # Analyze performance results
        for result in session.results:
            if "benchmark" in result.test_name.lower():
                metrics = result.metadata.get("benchmark_metrics", {})
                print(f"Execution Time: {metrics.get('execution_time', 0):.3f}s")
                
    finally:
        await runner.cleanup()
```

### Cross-Disciplinary Validation

```python
async def cross_disciplinary_validation():
    runner = ComprehensiveTestRunner()
    
    try:
        # Test across multiple disciplines
        disciplines = ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Biology"]
        sessions = await runner.run_cross_disciplinary_validation(
            research_output=research_output,
            disciplines=disciplines
        )
        
        # Compare results across disciplines
        for discipline, session in sessions.items():
            print(f"{discipline}: {session.success_rate:.1%} success rate")
            
    finally:
        await runner.cleanup()
```

## Configuration

The framework is highly configurable through the `FrameworkConfig` class:

    auto_generate_reports=True,
    report_formats=["json", "html", "pdf"],
    
    # Academic validation thresholds
    min_citation_accuracy=0.95,
    min_prisma_compliance=0.80,
    min_research_quality_score=0.75,
    
    # Performance thresholds
    max_response_time_seconds=30.0,
    max_memory_usage_mb=2048,
    min_throughput_papers_per_minute=60,
    
    # Supported disciplines
    supported_disciplines=[
        "Computer Science", "Medicine", "Environmental Science",
        "Physics", "Social Sciences", "Biology"
    ],
    
    # Citation styles
