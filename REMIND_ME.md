## PRD Summary: STORM-Academic Hybrid System

### 🎯 Project Vision
Create the most comprehensive AI-assisted research platform that produces academic-quality content by combining STORM's efficiency with academic rigor and multi-agent collaboration.

### 🔬 Core Problem Solved
Current AI writing tools lack:
- Access to recent academic research (250M+ papers)
- Systematic quality assurance and verification
- Accurate citations and fact-checking
- Specialized expertise through multi-agent systems

### 🚀 Key Innovations

#### 1. Hybrid Retrieval System
- **OpenAlex API**: 250M+ academic papers

- **Perplexity**: General knowledge fallback
- **Redis Caching**: Performance optimization

#### 2. Multi-Agent Architecture
- **AcademicResearcherAgent**: Academic source analysis
- **CriticAgent**: Quality and rigor review
- **CitationVerifierAgent**: Real-time fact-checking
- **WriterAgent**: Academic writing with proper citations

#### 3. Quality Assurance Pipeline
- Multi-level quality gates
- Real-time citation verification
- Grammar and style checking
- Academic rigor assessment
- Human feedback integration

#### 4. Enhanced Information Management
- Extended metadata storage (DOI, authors, impact factors)
- Source provenance tracking
- Citation quality scoring
- Academic formatting support

### 📊 Success Metrics
- **Citation Accuracy**: >95%
- **User Satisfaction**: NPS >8.0
- **Academic Quality**: Reviewer rating >4.0/5.0
- **Performance**: Research completion <10 minutes
- **Adoption**: 1000+ users within 6 months

### 🎯 Target Users
- **Academic Researchers**: Literature reviews, research summaries
- **Graduate Students**: Thesis research, academic writing
- **Research Institutions**: Automated research assistance
- **Science Journalists**: Well-sourced technical articles

### 🔧 Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Python microservices
- **APIs**: RESTful with OpenAPI specification
- **Database**: Redis (caching) + PostgreSQL (persistent)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with RBAC
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes
