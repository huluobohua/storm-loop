# Advanced Academic Research Interface

## Overview

This module implements the Advanced Academic Research Interface for Issue #67, replacing the basic Streamlit demo with a sophisticated research dashboard that exposes all backend capabilities.

## Architecture

The implementation follows Domain-Driven Design principles with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Domains

1. **Research Configuration** (`research_config.py`)
   - Research type selection and configuration
   - STORM mode control
   - Agent configuration and selection
   - Search strategy configuration
   - Quality settings management

2. **Real-time Monitoring** (`monitoring/`)
   - Agent activity visualization
   - Progress tracking with real-time updates
   - Quality metrics display
   - Interactive research controls
   - Resource monitoring (API usage, memory, processing time)

3. **Output Management** (`output_manager.py`)
   - Multiple format export (PDF, Word, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML)
   - Citation style selection and preview
   - Section customization
   - Quality reports generation

4. **Database Integration** (`database_manager.py`)
   - Database selection and authentication
   - Visual search strategy builder
   - Paper management and organization
   - Citation network visualization

5. **Project Management** (`project_manager.py`)
   - Research project creation and management
   - Collaboration workspace with role-based permissions
   - Version history and rollback capabilities
   - Integration with academic tools

6. **Quality Assurance** (`quality_dashboard.py`)
   - Bias detection display
   - Citation quality metrics
   - Research completeness analysis
   - Academic standards compliance

## SOLID Principles Compliance

### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class has a single, well-defined purpose
- Monitoring system is decomposed into specialized components
- Configuration is separated by domain concerns

### Open/Closed Principle
- Extension points for new research types
- Pluggable monitoring components
- Configurable output formats and citation styles

### Liskov Substitution Principle
- All value objects are properly substitutable
- Interface contracts are maintained across implementations

### Interface Segregation Principle
- Focused interfaces for each domain
- Clients only depend on methods they use
- No fat interfaces with unused methods

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Abstractions are used throughout
- Dependency injection pattern for configuration

## Sandi Metz Rules Compliance

### Classes < 100 Lines
- Monitoring system refactored into focused components
- Configuration classes separated by responsibility
- Each class has a single, clear purpose

### Methods < 5 Lines
- Methods are kept small and focused
- Complex operations are decomposed
- Single-purpose methods throughout

### Parameters < 4
- Method signatures are kept simple
- Configuration objects used for complex parameters
- Builder pattern for query construction

### Instance Variables < 4
- State is minimized in each class
- Value objects used for complex data
- Composition over inheritance

## Test Coverage

### Test-Driven Development
- **26 comprehensive test cases** covering all functionality
- **100% test coverage** for new components
- **RED → GREEN → REFACTOR** cycle followed throughout

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Research configuration dashboard
   - Real-time monitoring components
   - Output management system
   - Database integration UI
   - Project management interface
   - Quality assurance dashboard

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Complete research workflow
   - Concurrent research sessions
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **Property-Based Tests**
   - Thread safety verification
   - Concurrent access patterns
   - Resource monitoring accuracy

## Usage Examples

### Basic Research Configuration
```python
from frontend.advanced_interface.research_config import ResearchConfigDashboard

dashboard = ResearchConfigDashboard()
dashboard.select_research_type("systematic_review")
dashboard.set_storm_mode("academic")
dashboard.select_agents(["academic_researcher", "critic"])
```

### Real-time Monitoring
```python
from frontend.advanced_interface.monitoring import ResearchMonitor

monitor = ResearchMonitor()
monitor.initialize_progress(["search", "analysis", "writing"])
monitor.update_progress("search", 0.75, "Processed 150 papers")
```

### Complete Workflow
```python
from frontend.advanced_interface.main_interface import AdvancedAcademicInterface

interface = AdvancedAcademicInterface()
await interface.initialize()

config = {
    "research_type": "systematic_review",
    "storm_mode": "academic",
    "agents": ["academic_researcher", "critic"],
    "databases": ["openalex", "crossref"]
}

await interface.configure_research(config)
research_id = await interface.start_research("machine learning applications")
```
