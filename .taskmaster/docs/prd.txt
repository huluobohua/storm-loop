# PRISMA Assistant 80/20 Production Deployment - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Deploy the PRISMA Assistant 80/20 screening system as a production-ready tool for systematic review researchers. The system has achieved 60-70% auto-decision rates with sophisticated confidence scoring, targeting the 80/20 rule: automate ~80% of screening decisions with 80% confidence, leaving ~20% for human expertise.

## Problem Statement

Systematic review researchers spend 80% of their time on tedious screening work that could be automated, while only 20% on high-value analysis requiring human expertise. Current screening tools either:
- Lack confidence scoring for reliable automation
- Have poor precision leading to false decisions
- Don't integrate well with existing PRISMA workflows
- Require extensive training and setup

## Solution Overview

The PRISMA Assistant 80/20 system provides:

### Core Value Proposition
- **Time Savings**: 35-50% reduction in screening time
- **Quality Assurance**: 80% confidence threshold ensures reliable automation
- **PRISMA Compliance**: Native support for systematic review standards
- **Transparent Decisions**: Clear confidence scores and reasoning for all choices

### Technical Implementation
- Multi-signal confidence scoring with 6 weighted factors
- Advanced inclusion/exclusion pattern matching
- Domain-specific calibration (medical, technology, social sciences)
- Performance tracking and 80/20 target monitoring

## Current System Status

### Completed Implementation
- Enhanced PRISMA Assistant with 80/20 targeting (`knowledge_storm/prisma_assistant.py`)
- Sophisticated confidence scoring achieving 60-70% auto-decision rate
