        Protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023001234). We searched multiple databases including 
        PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria required randomized 
        controlled trials with adult participants. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and 
        data extraction using standardized forms. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool. 
        Meta-analysis was performed using random effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed and publication 
        bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. GRADE assessment was used to evaluate 
        certainty of evidence. Study characteristics included population demographics and intervention details. 
        Results showed significant improvements in outcomes with moderate certainty of evidence.
