Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane through December 2022. Inclusion criteria: studies comparing AI to ophthalmologist assessment with sensitivity/specificity data.

Pooled sensitivity was 88.7% (95% CI: 86.8-90.6) and specificity 92.5% (95% CI: 90.9-94.1). Substantial heterogeneity was noted (IÂ²=84%).
